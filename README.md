# Clean Player

A simple Flutter media player with a dark theme because VLC's light mode was bothering me 😅

## Why I Made This

Honestly, I just got tired of VLC's bright interface and wanted something that looks clean and modern. This is basically my attempt at making a media player that doesn't hurt my eyes when I'm watching stuff at night.

## Features

- 🎬 Dark theme by default (because who needs bright UIs?)
- 📁 Recent files for quick access
- 🎮 Keyboard shortcuts for desktop
- 📝 Subtitle support (SRT files and internal tracks) with full customization
- 🎵 Audio track selection with language detection (MKV files)
- 🔊 Volume enhancement (boost, EQ, normalization)
- 🎵 Playlist management
- ⚙️ Basic settings

## Getting Started

Just your typical Flutter project:

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

Works on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, and Web (though desktop is where it really shines).

## What's Inside

- Clean, minimal UI
- Recent files tracking
- Native subtitle support (internal tracks and external SRT files)
- Subtitle styling (font size, color, background, alignment, spacing)
- Audio track selection with language detection for MKV files
- Volume enhancement with presets (Bass Boost, Treble Boost, Loud, Clear)
- Playlist modal
- Settings panel
- Keyboard shortcuts

Nothing fancy, just a media player that doesn't blind you with white backgrounds and has some nice audio enhancement features. Perfect for those late-night movie sessions! 🍿
