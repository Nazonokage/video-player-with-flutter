Prototype Project ‚Äì QA Test Log (All Pending Features)
======================================================

üìù Reports & Required Features (Prioritized)
--------------------------------------------

[HIGH] OSD / File Info:
implemented - Current file name should always be visible on player UI. 
implemented - Auto-show OSD info at video start (especially when skipping to next/prev).

[HIGH] Subtitles:
- Subtitles work in windowed mode, but in fullscreen changes require program restart.
- Duplication issue:
  - When video already has built-in subtitles (signs/text), external subtitles overlap ‚Üí looks like double subs.
  - Works, but not seamless ‚Üí needs logic to handle built-in + external subs better.

[MEDIUM] Subtitles ‚Äì Customization:
- Need subtitle background customization option.

[MEDIUM] Preferences:
- Save all latest settings (persist after program restart).

[MEDIUM] Thumbnail System:
- On exit/close, the player should automatically capture a screenshot of the last displayed frame.
- Save this screenshot locally as a thumbnail (e.g., video_name_thumb.jpg).
- Use saved thumbnails when loading recent list or playlists.
- Purpose: prevent lingering sounds from recent videos by rendering static thumbnails instead of loading the video directly.

[LOW] UI / Controls:
- Decrease control bar and top bar height ‚Üí allow more video space.
- Mouse auto-disappears after 3 seconds when idle.

[LOW] Playback:
- Playlist plays next video automatically after finishing.

[LOW] Interactions:
- Right-click menu for settings.
 implemented - Keyboard shortcuts:
  - I ‚Üí Show OSD info.
  - M ‚Üí Mute/unmute.

[LOW] System / Power Management:
- Consider feature to prevent PC from sleeping while video is playing (optional toggle).
